The question asks about the size of the RAM of the server hosted on AWS in us-east-1 region.\n\nStep 2: Compare this with the expert answer. The expert responds that they can't answer the question because the RAM specification isn't in the context.\n\nStep 3: Compare the expert answer to the submitted answer. The submitted answer says essentially the same thing - that the context does not provide information about the amount of RAM the server has.\n\nStep 4: Confirm there are no factual differences between the expert and the submitted answer. In this case, both responses align - neither can provide the RAM size because it's not specified in the context.\n\nGiven this, the two answers match in terms of the content. They both identify that the question cannot be answered based on the provided context. \n\nGRADE: C",

Please choose ONE option for the grade: either \"C\" for correct answers, or \"I\" for incorrect answers.\n\nFor example, after reviewing a correct answer you might write 'GRADE: C' or after reviewing an incorrect answer you might write 'GRADE: I'.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct.

This means that the information given in the context is insufficient for the expert to answer the question. \n\nStep 2: Analyze the submitted answer- The submission says \"I cannot answer this question because the provided context only gives information about the cafeteria's lunch hours and does not contain any data regarding the molecular weight of water\". This signifies that the submission also acknowledges that the context does not provide enough information to answer the question.\n\nStep 3: Compare both answers- Both the expert and the submission are essentially saying the same thing: the context does not provide the necessary information to answer the question.\n\nConclusion: The submitted answer does contain the content in the expert answer. Hence, \n\nGRADE: C",

There are no factual discrepancies, and the submitted answer captures the content of the expert's answer accurately.\n\nConclusion: The submission is correct as it identifies the same conflict between the context and the question as the expert does.\n\nGRADE: C",

However, the context contains no information about Company B's stock.\n\nStep 2: Compare the expert answer to the context.\nThe expert correctly explains that the question cannot be answered based on the provided context, as there is no information given about Company B's stock. \n\nStep 3: Compare the submitted answer to the expert answer and context.\nThe submitter also correctly explains that the question cannot be answered due to lack of context about Company B's stock, just like the expert. \n\nBased on this analysis, both the expert and the submitter provided the same answer on factual grounds, despite some differences in expression. The submission does contain the same factual content as the expert answer.\n\nFinal grade: GRADE: C.",

The expert's response was \"I cannot answer this question based on the provided context.\" This is because the context doesn't relate to the speed of light in any way.

In this case, the submission states, \"I cannot answer this question because the context provided does not include information about the speed of light.\" Step 4: Compare the content of both the answers.
