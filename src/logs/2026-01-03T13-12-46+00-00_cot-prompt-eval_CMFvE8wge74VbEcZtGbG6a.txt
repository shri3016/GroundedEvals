Ignore any differences in style, grammar, or punctuation.\n\nDoes the submission contain the content in the expert answer?\n\n\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.  Please choose ONE option for the grade: either \"C\" for correct answers, or \"I\" for incorrect answers.\n\nFor example, after reviewing a correct answer you might write 'GRADE: C' or after reviewing an incorrect answer you might write 'GRADE: I'.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then, end with your answer formatted as 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.\n\n",

Check for any additional information in the submitted answer that goes beyond the expert answer: The submitted answer provides some additional context and reasoning, including: - Listing the given information in the context - Explaining that the required information is present in the context - Arriving at the final answer by referencing the context However, the key factual content matching the expert answer is still present. 4. Determine if the submission is correct or incorrect based on the presence of the key information from the expert...",
